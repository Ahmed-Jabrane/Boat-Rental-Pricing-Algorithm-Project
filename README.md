# Boat Rental Pricing Algorithm Project

## Description

The Boat Rental Pricing Algorithm Project aims to develop a reliable and efficient pricing algorithm for boat rentals in various popular locations in France, including Marseille, Cassis, Hy√®res, Cannes, Corse, and La Rochelle. The project leverages data retrieved from the "clickandboat" website to analyze various factors that influence the pricing of boat rentals in these locations.

Key components of the project include:
1. **Data Retrieval**: A module that facilitates the retrieval of boat rental data from the "clickandboat" website.
2. **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis to identify factors that influence boat rental prices and to gather insights that will inform the pricing algorithm.
3. **Pricing Algorithm**: Development of a pricing algorithm that uses the data and insights gathered to suggest optimal rental prices. This might involve the use of mathematical models or machine learning algorithms.
4. **Web Application**: A Flask web application that provides a user interface or API for interacting with the pricing algorithm, potentially allowing users to input data and receive pricing recommendations.

## Structure

The project follows a structured layout with separate directories for source code (`src/`), Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`), tests (`tests/`), data (`data/`), and a web application (`app/`). 

- **src/**: Contains the main Python scripts including data retrieval and pricing algorithm implementation.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
- **tests/**: Houses unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.
- **data/**: Used for storing raw and processed data files.
- **app/**: Contains a Flask application offering a user interface or API for the pricing algorithm.

## Usage

To use the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Use the `DataRetriever` class from the `src/data_retriever.py` script to fetch data.
4. Analyze the data and develop the pricing algorithm using the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
5. Run the Flask application in the `app/` directory to interact with the pricing algorithm.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (to be created).

This description outlines the main components and goals of your project. You can add more details, such as the technologies used, the methods applied in the pricing algorithm, screenshots of the application, etc., as the project progresses. You can also create additional documentation files, like a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide potential contributors.
